bot.py is the main program. Runs with python3.
IRC_bot.py is the irc class that holds all the details.
This bot currently checks each message received in the chat for the list of banned words and if the 
'chatter' uses banned words, reprimands them.

cleanData.py reads from BANNABLE_WORDS, removes duplicates, generates associated leetspeech phrases, 
and writes out to BANNED_WORDS. The actual bot reads from BANNED_WORDS. If you want to add new phrases
or words to ban, add them to the end of BANNABLE_WORDS and then run cleanData.py. They will be sorted,
added, and associated leetspeach words will be added. If you have any questions please reach out to me.
