###IRC BOT
This bot currently checks each message received in the chat for the list of banned words and if the 
'chatter' uses banned words, reprimands them.

##File Structure
* bot.py
  * To Run: 'python3 bot.py'
* IRC_bot.py 
  * IRC class handles all discussion with the server.


##Housekeeping
cleanData.py reads from BANNABLE_WORDS, removes duplicates, generates associated leetspeech phrases, 
and writes out to BANNED_WORDS. If you want to add new phrases or words to ban, add them to the end of BANNABLE_WORDS 
and then run cleanData.py. They will be sorted,added, and associated leetspeach words will be added. 
If you have any questions please reach out to me.
